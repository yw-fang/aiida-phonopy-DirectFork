## This is a personal fork of Abel's AiiDA Phonopy plugin
Comared to Abel's repository, I added some optimized features and tools for VASP.

AiiDA Phonopy plugin
====================

This a phonopy plugin for AiiDA. This plugin includes workflows to calculate
phonon band structure, DOS, thermal properties and mode Gruneisen parameters.
It provides interfaces for VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO and LAMMPS to calculate the 
atomic forces and relax the crystal structure. 


Examples
--------
Some test calculations are found in the folder **/examples**

- plugins: examples of basic functionality of phonopy remote plugin. These tests require 
the previous calculation of forces or force constants that should be already stored in the database
- workchains: examples of the full phonon calculation / gruneisen parameters from scratch. These workflows
require the installation of plugins for VASP, LAMMPS or QuantumESPRESSO.
- tools: example scripts for visualize the results of phonon/gruneisen workchains. These scripts require
 matplotlib.
